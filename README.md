Inflection model for Gilaki, a low-resource northwestern Iranian language. 

Main resource for the grammar and writing-style:
- The Gilaki Language by V.S. Rastorgueva

Other resources for collecting data:

### Scope of the project
The initial scope of this project is to build a simple inflection model using PyFOMA and then train a transformer model using synthetic data generated by the initial model. 

This project will be handed in as the final project for the Computational Morphology course instructed by Jeremy Barnes.
